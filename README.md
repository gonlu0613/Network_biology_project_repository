# Network_biology_project_repository

Github repository of my MSB1014 Network Biology project. 
This networks were built in R and the results were transfered to Cytoscape using RCy3. 
Please read the requirements to know which are the required packages and where to find the data.

The notebook serves as a way to create the networks and the families investigated could be easily changed as it works with standalone functions found in the helper_functions.r file.
